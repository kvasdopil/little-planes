## Game Modes

### Edit Mode âœ…

- Activated when a city is selected
- Shows a route preview from selected city to cursor
- Can be exited by:
  - Clicking on the background
  - Selecting the same city again
  - Creating a new route
- Used for:
  - Creating routes between cities
  - Modifying city properties
  - Managing resource allocation

### Play Mode (Planned)

- Active gameplay state
- Resource and trade simulation
- City growth and development
- Economic management
- Network optimization

## Development Guidelines

1. Follow TypeScript best practices
2. Write clean, documented code
3. Create reusable components
4. Optimize for performance
5. Regular testing and bug fixing

## Deployment Strategy

1. Build optimization
2. GCP Cloud Storage for static hosting
3. Cloud Run for any backend services
4. Automated deployments via CI/CD
