## Tech Stack

- React with TypeScript for UI and game logic
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Vite for build tooling and development
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality
- Terraform for GCP deployment

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Structure

- [x] Initialize project with Vite
- [x] Set up TypeScript configuration
- [x] Configure ESLint and Prettier
- [x] Set up Three.js with React Three Fiber
- [x] Create basic project structure
- [x] Set up deployment configuration

### Phase 2: Core Game Engine

- [ ] Implement basic 3D scene setup
- [ ] Add camera controls
- [ ] Create plane model loading system
- [ ] Implement basic physics system
- [ ] Set up collision detection

### Phase 3: Game Mechanics

- [ ] Implement plane controls
- [ ] Add basic flight physics
- [ ] Create scoring system
- [ ] Implement game states (start, play, end)
- [ ] Add basic AI for enemy planes

### Phase 4: Graphics and Effects

- [ ] Add environment (sky, terrain)
- [ ] Implement particle effects
- [ ] Add lighting effects
- [ ] Create explosion animations
- [ ] Optimize performance

### Phase 5: UI and Polish

- [ ] Design and implement HUD
- [ ] Add menus and settings
- [ ] Implement sound effects
- [ ] Add background music
- [ ] Create tutorial system

### Phase 6: Deployment and Testing

- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Implement automated testing
- [ ] Optimize build size
- [ ] Deploy to GCP
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization

## Development Guidelines

1. Follow TypeScript best practices
2. Write clean, documented code
3. Create reusable components
4. Optimize for performance
5. Regular testing and bug fixing

## Deployment Strategy

1. Build optimization
2. GCP Cloud Storage for static hosting
3. Cloud Run for any backend services
4. Automated deployments via CI/CD
